Introduction to Content Studio, content types and x-data.


== Content Studio

https://market.enonic.com/vendors/enonic/content-studio[Content Studio^] is the editorial interface used to create and manage content. It was pre-installed from https://market.enonic.com[Enonic Market^] as a part of the `Essentials` template when you started the sandbox, and can now be accessed from the XP menu.

*Click btn:[Content Studio]* in the XP menu to launch it.

When your own application was started, it automatically created a content project called `Intro Project` and populated it with content. Since this is the only available project at the moment, Content Studio will automatically open it, revealing the list of sample content.

TIP: The current project is shown at the top of Content Studio.

== Content type: Person

To edit an item, simply select it and click `Edit` in the menu bar, or by using right click. When editing a Person content item, this is what the form looks like in Content Studio. On bigger screens you will also get a preview on the right-hand side.

The form comes from the content type definition, which is located inside the app. Here is what it looks like:

./src/main/resources/site/content-type/person/person.xml
[source,XML]
----
include::{sourcedir}/src/main/resources/site/content-types/person/person.xml[]
----

When used to create content, it is stored like this:

.Persisted content for Uma Thurman
[source,JSON]
----
{
  "valid": true,
  "displayName": "Uma Thurman",
  "type": "com.example.myapp:person",
  "owner": "user:system:su",
  "language": "en",
  "modifiedTime": "2018-07-03T05:58:55.025Z",
  "modifier": "user:system:su",
  "creator": "user:system:su",
  "createdTime": "2018-07-03T05:57:35.292Z",
  "publish": {
    "first": "2024-01-18T12:08:23.167Z",
    "from": "2024-01-18T12:08:23.167Z"
  },
  "data": {
    "photos": "8d47792f-0ae6-4d74-a6e4-bab0e8d2374b",
    "bio": "Uma Karuna Thurman was born in Boston, Massachusetts, into a highly unorthodox and Eurocentric family",
    "dateofbirth": "1970-04-29"
  }
}
----

== X-Data: Social media

When editing a Person, you'll notice an additional subset of fields inside the Content form with title `Social Media`. This is strictly speaking a separate form, injected into the Person content type - we call it "eXtended data" (or just "x-data").

X-data can be applied across multiple content types. In this app for instance, the `Social Media` form is also available on the `Movie` content type. More interestingly, X-data can even be injected from a different application - at runtime.

This is what the definition looks like:

./src/main/resources/site/x-data/some/some.xml
[source,XML]
----
include::{sourcedir}/src/main/resources/site/x-data/SoMe/SoMe.xml[]
----

You can also see what the persisted version looks like in the JSON.

{
  "data": {
    "photos": "8d47792f-0ae6-4d74-a6e4-bab0e8d2374b",
    "bio": "Uma Karuna Thurman was born in Boston, Massachusetts, into a highly unorthodox and Eurocentric family",
    "dateofbirth": "1970-04-29"
  },
  "x": {
    "com-example-myapp": {
      "SoMe": {
        "imdb": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000235/"
      }
    }
  }
}

== Adding a new content type

Let's do a practical exercise by adding a new content type called `Review` to your app. This will allow you to create reviews of movies.

. From inside the `samples/` folder of your app, *copy or move* the `review/` folder to `src/main/resources/site/content-types/`.
. *Write a review*. Content Studio should pick up the changes immediately. From the Content navigation view click btn:[New], then select content type `Review` and start filling out the form fields in the new content item.
