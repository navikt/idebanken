Installing the CLI and creating a development sandbox.

== Install CLI

The https://developer.enonic.com/docs/enonic-cli[Enonic Command Line Interface^] is an essential tool for developers working with Enonic.

If you have `npm` on your device, run this command:

  npm install -g @enonic/cli

If not, here are some https://developer.enonic.com/start[alternative ways to install Enonic CLI^]

To verify that the CLI has been installed, run `enonic -v`. This should output the version of your installed CLI.

To see all available options, simply run `enonic`.

TIP: To upgrade, use `enonic latest`. If there are new versions you will see instructions on how to upgrade.

== Create a sandbox

A https://developer.enonic.com/docs/xp/stable/development/sandboxes[sandbox^] is a local development instance of the platform - Enonic XP. Create and start a sandbox called `mysandbox` by running this command in your terminal:

  enonic sandbox create mysandbox -t essentials -f

NOTE: `-f` flag will force using the most recent release of Enonic XP and automatically start the sandbox.

== Sandbox Admin

Let's have a look at the Sandbox' web interface - aka XP admin. Open http://localhost:8080[http://localhost:8080^] in your browser (or just click the link).

You should now see the XP boot page:

.XP Boot page

The boot page provides an overview of the sandbox, including installed application, as well as the https://developer.enonic.com/docs/xp/stable/deployment/config[standard configuration files^].

Click btn:[Log In as Guest] to open the XP admin dashboard. You should now see something like this:

.The XP admin dashboard

You are now on the admin dashboard. The right hand menu (aka `XP menu`) enables navigation between admin tools. Admin tools may be injected as extensions via applications.

NOTE: If things don't look exactly the same, don't worry. In every new version of XP the background picture gets updated. Also, admin dashboard is automatically localized - based on your browsers preferred language.


== Coming up

You're now familiar with the CLI and sandboxes. In the next chapter you'll get create an <<app#, Enonic application>>.
