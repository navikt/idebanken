Get familiar with the Guillotine API - our cutting edge headless GraphQL content API

== Guillotine

The Headless API aka https://market.enonic.com/vendors/enonic/guillotine[Guillotine^] - yes, we take headlessness seriously around here - provides access to all the content within your project. Clients requesting content will naturally only get access to the content they have read-permissions for. The `Intro project` is configured with public read access for everything.

Click the GraphQL icon in the Content Studio's left hand menu to open `Query Playground`. Here you may test and play with the GraphQL API directly.

The API documentation is available from the Top left `file cabinet icon`. Use the tabs on the top right to query against the Draft or Master branch, accessing the draft and published items respectively.

== Sample queries

Below are some example queries you can use for fetching the sample content.

=== Get Persons

.Get display name and _path of the first 3 items in the `/persons` folder:
[source,GraphQL]
----
{
 guillotine {
  getChildren(key:"/persons" first:3){
    displayName
    _path
    }
  }
}
----

.Sample response:
[source,JSON]
----
{
  "data": {
    "guillotine": {
      "getChildren": [
        {
          "displayName": "Léa Seydoux",
          "_path": "/persons/lea-seydoux"
        },
        {
          "displayName": "Jeffrey Wright",
          "_path": "/persons/jeffrey-wright"
        },
        {
          "displayName": "Daniel Craig",
          "_path": "/persons/daniel-craig"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
----

=== Query variables

GraphQL also supports the concept of query variables. Similar to parameters in functions, you may pass variables to a query.

Query variables are defined with JSON. You can add them using the `Variables` button below the query editor.

[source,JSON]
----
{
  "path": "/persons"
}
----

With the variable set, update your query to use the variable. This query should provide the exact same response as it did before.

.The Person query, this time using path as a variable:
[source,GraphQL]
----
query($path:ID!){
 guillotine {
  getChildren(key:$path first:3){
    displayName
    _path
    }
  }
}
----

=== Movies and cast

IMPORTANT: The GraphQL schema is automatically generated from your application and schemas. If you used a different name than `com.example.myapp` when the app was created, you would have to replace both `com.example.myapp:movie` and the GraphQL type `com_example_myapp_Movie` for the query below to work.

.Get display name and the cast of the first movie:
[source,GraphQL]
----
{
  guillotine {
    queryDsl(query: {
      term: {
        field: "type",
        value: {
          string: "com.example.myapp:movie"
        }
      }
    }, first: 1) {
      displayName
      ... on com_example_myapp_Movie {
        data {
          cast {
            actor {
              displayName
            }
            character
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
----

.Sample response
[source,JSON]
----
{
  "data": {
    "guillotine": {
      "queryDsl": [
        {
          "displayName": "The Matrix",
          "data": {
            "cast": [
              {
                "actor": {
                  "displayName": "Keanu Reeves"
                },
                "character": "Neo"
              },
              {
                "actor": {
                  "displayName": "Carrie-Anne Moss"
                },
                "character": "Trinity"
              }
            ]
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
----

== Image handling

In this case, Guillotine plays tag-team with XP's image service, which is capable of delivering real-time cropped and optimized versions of images. In this case we are requesting a 400 x 400px version of the image.

The query below shows the name of actors containing the term `morgan`, and provide a link to a cropped image of the actor.

IMPORTANT: Again, if your app was called something else than `com.example.myapp`, replace `com.example.myapp:person` and `com_example_myapp_Person` for the query below to work.

.Name of persons and a link to 400x400 scaled photo
[source,GraphQL]
----
{
  guillotine {
    queryDsl(query: {
      boolean: {
        must: [
          {
            ngram: {
              fields: ["_allText"],
              query: "morgan"
            }
          },
          {
            term: {
              field: "type",
              value: {
                string: "com.example.myapp:person"
              }
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    }, first: 1) {
      ... on com_example_myapp_Person {
    	  displayName
        data {
          photos(first:1){
            ... on media_Image {
              imageUrl(type:absolute scale:"block(400,400)")
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
----

.Sample response
[source,JSON]
----
{
  "data": {
    "guillotine": {
      "queryDsl": [
        {
          "displayName": "Morgan Freeman",
          "data": {
            "photos": [
              {
                "imageUrl": "http://localhost:8080/admin/site/preview/intro/draft/_/image/7ab1f76a-69a1-490f-b505-6eb6773c7cec:603726cc4fa712aa1b70c7eb64e1349f664494c3/block-400-400/morgan-freeman.jpg"
              }
            ]
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
----

When looking at the result in Query Playground, you can see the actual image by hovering over the link:

image::morgan-photo.png["Cropped version of Morgan Freemans image", width="1024px"]

The original higher resolution image is stored as a content item, just like persons and reviews. This is what it looks like from Content Studio:

image::morgan-original.png["The original version of Morgan Freemans photo is widescreen, with a red "autofocus" circle marked around his face", width="1024px"]

NOTE: The red "autofocus" circle, when set, helps the image service to crop the images optimally - as you can see above.

== API augmentation

*Now the real magic begins!* You may programmatically extend and augment the Guillotine API - for a fully customizable back-end. 

The use-cases are limitless, but rather than babbling about it - lets see it in action!

=== The age field

We'll keep it simple. In a few steps you'll add a new `age` field to the Person content type, and use the `dateofbirth` to calculate the result.

. From the `samples/` folder of your app, *copy or move* the `guillotine/` folder to `src/main/resources/`. You should then have the following TypeScript controller ready:
+
./src/main/resources/guillotine/guillotine.ts
[source,TypeScript]
----
include::{sourcedir}/samples/guillotine/guillotine.ts[]
----
+
. Guillotine requires the app to be redeployed (or restarted) in order to pick up changes to schemas and/or controllers. Stop the build (using control-c) and start it again:
+
  ^c
  enonic dev
+
. Back in Query Playground, run the following query: 
+
.Query using the new field
[source,GraphQL]
----
{
  guillotine {
    getChildren(key: "/persons", first: 2) {
      displayName
      ... on com_example_myapp_Person {
        data {
          age
          dateofbirth
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
----
+
The response should now contain a new age filed, with a calculated value:
+
.Query response
[source,JSON]
----
{
  "data": {
    "guillotine": {
      "getChildren": [
        {
          "displayName": "Léa Seydoux",
          "data": {
            "age": 38,
            "dateofbirth": "1985-07-01"
          }
        },
        {
          "displayName": "Jeffrey Wright",
          "data": {
            "age": 58,
            "dateofbirth": "1965-12-07"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
----

As you have now seen, XP lets you run server-side https://developer.enonic.com/docs/xp/stable/framework[TypeScript and JavaScript code]. API augmentation is just the tip of the iceberg - believe us.

== One last thing

With GraphQL queries flowing from your fingertips. It's time for the big finale where you <<deploy#, deploy your app to the Enonic cloud>>.
